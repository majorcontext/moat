            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions.

            Focus on bugs, security issues, and correctness problems. Don't flag style nits
            or documentation gaps unless they indicate a real problem. Be concise — only
            comment if you found something worth calling out. If the PR looks good, say so
            briefly.

            Start your review with a markdown heading containing "Review".

            Post your review as a comment using `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool.
